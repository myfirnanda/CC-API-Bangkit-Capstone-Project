32. Himalayan Pink Salt To Taste
33. 250G Baby Spinach
34. 2 Vegan Sausages Such As Field Roast Chipotle Flavour Sliced Into Thin Discs
35. Handful Of Grated Vegan Cheese","1. Preheat The Oven To 200°C / 400°F / Gas Mark 6.
2. To Prepare The Butternut, Begin By Peeling With A Sharp Knife. I Find The Easiest Way To Do This Is To First Slice Off The Ends, Followed By Cutting It In Half Across The Middle. You Can Now Slice The Skin Off From Top To Bottom On Each Half. Once Peeled, Cut Each Half Lengthways Through The Middle And Scoop The Seeds And Stringy Bits From The Bottom Half. Now Slice Each Segment Thinly, So You Have Lots Of Half Crescent ‘Pasta’ Sheets.
3. Lay The Butternut Slices On An Oven Tray And Drizzle Over The Olive Oil And Maple Syrup. Chop The Sage Leaves Into 1Cm Wide Ribbons And Sprinkle These On With Some Black Pepper. Cook In The Oven For 25 Minutes.
4. While The Butternut Slices Are Cooking, Prepare The Tomato Sauce. Finely Chop The Red Onion, Garlic And Chilli And Chop The Mushrooms Into Quarters. Heat The Olive Oil On A Medium Heat In A Large Pan And Add The Spices: Cooking These First Releases The Flavours. Add The Onion, Garlic, Chilli And Mushrooms And Cook For About 10 Minutes (Or When Slightly Browned And Soft).
5. Chop The Tomatoes Into Small Chunks And Add These To The Pan With The Pepper/Tomato Paste, Red Wine And Vinegar. Simmer For 30-40 Minutes, Or Until Reduced. It Should Be Thick, But Still Loose. Add The Black Pepper Towards The End Of Cooking.
6. While The Tomato Sauce Is Reducing You Can Make The White Sauce. Heat The Olive Oil On A Medium Heat In A Saucepan And Add The Spices And Garlic. Keep An Eye On The Garlic – You Want It To Brown Lightly But Not Burn. Once The Garlic Has Begun To Colour Stir In The Flour – Much Like Making A Roux For A Béchamel Sauce. Stir For A Minute And Then Add The Milk To Create A Sauce, Continuing To Stir. Next, Add The Tofu And Mash It Into The Sauce Using The Back Of The Spoon. You Can Now Stir In The Remaining Ingredients And Leave To Simmer For 10 Minutes. Again, It Should Be Thick But Loose.
7. Finally, Wilt The Spinach By Putting It In A Pan On A Low Heat. Give It A Stir And Drain The Water- This Only Takes About 5 Minutes.
8. Now For The Assembly! Layer The Ingredients In A Deep Dish Or Tin. I Put Mine Together In The Following Order: Tomato Sauce, White Sauce, Spinach And Sausage Slices, Butternut Squash. Repeat Until You Have Used All The Ingredients And Finish With A Sprinkling Of Cheese.
9. Cook In The Oven For 20 Minutes, Or Until The Top Is Nice And Crisp. Let It Stand For 5 Minutes Before Serving, So That The Layers Hold Their Shape.
10. Wonderful! Serve With Steamed Greens And A Miso Dressing, Which Work Really Well As A Contrasting Tang To All Of The Earthy Flavours Of The Lasagne.

14. Then Drain Your Lentils And Them To The Pot And Stir Through.
15. If This Makes The Mixture Too Dry Add Some More Boiling Water In Small Amounts. If You Need To Add A Lot Of Water You Can Throw In Another Half A Stock Cube So You Don’T Dilute All The Flavour.
16. Leave The Mixture To Simmer For Around 40-45 Minutes But Check It And Stir It Constantly To Make Sure It Doesn’T Burn. Keep The Heat Low To Avoid This Happening.
17. Add In A About A Tablespoon Of Brown Sauce At The End Of The Cooking Process And Stir It Though.
18. When The Lentil Mix Is Cooked Through Add It To Your Baking Dish.
19. Mash Your Potatoes With Soya Butter And Unsweetened Soya Milk Or Another Plant Milk (I Would Not Recommend Anything Sweet Or Almond Milk).
20. Spread The Mashed Potato Over The Top Of The Lentil Mix, Smoothing It Out With A Fork. We Added Some Parsley On Top.
21. If You Have Any Violife Cheese You Could Add This Over The Top But That Is Optional.
22. Then Bake The Shepherd’S Pie A Hot Oven For 20-30 Minutes Until The Potato Starts To Go Golden Brown. If You Don’T Bake It Until The Following Day It Will Need Longer.

https://veganuary.com/recipes/chocolate-fudge-cake/,Chocolate Fudge Cake,"1. 260G Selfraising Flour
2. 40G Cocoa Powder
3. 2 Teaspoons Of Baking Powder
4. 12 Teaspoon Of Salt
5. 200G Golden Caster Sugar
6. 200G Dairyfree Spread I Use Pure Sunflower Spread
7. 200G Plain Dairyfree Chocolate 70 Or More
8. 400Cups Sweetened Soya Milk I Used The Blue Vive Soy As It Has A Beautiful Vanilla Flavour To It
9. 1 Tablespoon Of Vanilla Extract
10. Ganache Filling  Topping
11. 100G Plain Chocolate 70 Or More
12. 100G Icing Sugar
13. 160Cups Tin Of Coconut Cream
14. 1 Tablespoon Of Vanilla Extract
15. 1 Tablespoon Of Dairyfree Spread","1. For The Cake:
2. Pop The Oven On To 180 Degrees Centrigrade
3. Grease Two 8 Inch Cake Tins (I Recommend You Use Springform Tins If You Can As These Sponges Have A Delicate Structure)
4. Mix The Flour, Cocoa Powder, Salt Baking Powder Together In One Bowl And Set To One Side
5. Melt The Plain Chocolate And Whisk Together With The Dairy-Free Spread, Caster Sugar, Soya Milk, & Vanilla Extract
6. Add The Dry Ingredients To The Wet Ingredients And Mix With A Metal Spoon Only Until They Are Combined. Warning – Don’T Use An Electric Whisk And Don’T Mix Any Longer Than Absolutely Necessary – I Really Mean It When I Say Just Enough To Ensure The Ingredients Are Combined. Any Lumps Will Work Themselves Out In The Oven. If You’Re New To Egg-Free Baking Then This May Seem Counter-Intuitive But Unlike Traditional Baking, You Want To Keep Air Out Until The Cakes Are In The Oven.
7. Tap The Bowl On The Work Surface To Knock Any Air Out Of The Mixture
8. Spoon Equally Into Each Of The Cake Tins
9. Tap Each Cake Tin On The Work Surface To Knock Out Any Air You Can
10. Place The Tins In The Oven For 20-25 Minutes Depending On Your Oven
11. Remove From The Oven & Test With A Knife To Ensure Fully Cooked
12. Leave To Cool As They Are For 5-10 Minutes Then Remove The Sides Of The Tin & Leave To Cool Entirely
13. You Should Find That The Sponges Level Off Quite Nicely So There’Ll Be No Need To Slice Off The Top Of One But If You Need To, Do So With Care
14. For The Ganache:
15. Melt The Chocolate, Coconut Cream, And Dairy-Free Spread Over A Low Heat
16. Sift In The Icing Sugar And Stir In Gently Until You Have A Smooth, Glossy Mixture
17. Leave To Cool Enough To Be Firmer But Not Too Firm So You Can Still Pour Over The Top Of The Finished Cake
18. Spread Some Of The Ganache Onto The Bottom Sponge And Gently Place The Second Sponge On Top
19. Once The Ganache Has Cooled Enough, Pour Over The Cake, Using A Knife To Spread It Evenly Around The Sides.
20. Garnish As You Fancy, I Did So With Mixed Berries As You Can See!
21. Tip: Decorate The Cake On A Plate So That Any Excess Ganache Is Caught. You May Find It Helps To Pop It In The Fridge To Firm Up The Ganache So You Can Go Back Over With A Knife To Improve The Presentation On The Sides. If You’Re A Real Perfectionist When It Comes To Presentation (Which I Wasn’T On This Occassion), A Knife Warmed Under The Hot Tap Will Help You To Achieve A Smooth & Glossy Finish When Finishing Off The Sides).",320,42,2,17,Dessert,Dinner,1,https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Chocolate-Fudge-Cake-1200x800.jpg,chocolate-fudge-cake

5. Remove The Chipotle Chilli From The Water And Remove The Seeds And Membrane (If You Don’T Do This Your Mouth Will Be On Fire!). Finely Chop The Rest.

Add The Cumin And Paprika, Give It A Stir And Then Add The Pinto Beans. While This Is Cooking You Can Make The Socca Tacos.
7. Place A Good, Non-Stick Frying Pan On A Medium Heat, Adding A Little Oil If Needed (See Note). Once The Pan Is Hot, Spoon In Some Of The Socca Batter. I Find A Large Serving Spoon Is About The Right Amount – Making About 6 Tortillas.
8. Wait For Bubbles To Appear In The Batter. Once They Have All Popped, Flip The Tortilla Over And Allow The Other Side To Cook – About 2 Minutes On Each Side.
9. Pop Them On A Plate Ready To Serve.

If Your Pan Is Not Super Non-Stick, Use A Little Oil For The Socca, As You Would For Regular Pancakes.If You Don’T Want To Be Cooking The Hot Filling And The Socca Tortillas At The Same Time, Make The Tortillas First And Set Aside On A Plate – They Don’T Need To Be Hot To Serve.I’Ve Suggested Using Organic Limes Because Not Only Do They Taste Great, But They Are Unwaxed (Which Is Particularly Important If You’Re Using The Zest).",250,35,4,5,Main Course,Dinner,0,https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_4528.jpg,smoky-socca-tacos-and-peach-salsa

14. Nori Sheets  1 Pack","1. Rinse And Drain The Sushi Rice In A Sieve. Place The Rice In A Small Saucepan With 220Ml Of Water, Bring Up To A Boil, Lower The Heat To A Gentle Simmer, Cover And Cook For 15 Minutes Until All The Water Has Been Absorbed.
2. Drain And Wrap The Tofu In Kitchen Paper Then Place Between Two Plates With Something Heavy On Top Like A Couple Of Tins. Leave To Press For 20 Minutes. This Process Allows The Tofu To Take On More Flavour.
3. Preheat The Oven To 190 Degrees Celsius.
4. Prepare The Peanut Sauce. Mix The Peanut Butter With 1 Tbsp Of Soy Sauce, 1.5 Tbsp Of Mirin, 1 Tsp Of Sesame Oil And 1 Tbsp Of Water. Peel And Finely Chop Or Grate The Garlic, Then Add To The Sauce. Your Sauce Should Be The Consistency Of Single Cream. If Necessary Add A Splash More Of Water To Loosen.
5. Prepare The Filling. Cut The Avocado In Half, Remove The Pit And Scoop The Flesh Away From The Skin, Keeping The Shape Intact. Cut The Avocado Into Strips Lengthways. Peel And Grate The Carrot. Divide Both Into 4 Equal Portions. Cut The Tofu Into 8 Slices And Coat With 1 Tsp Of Soy Sauce. Place The Coated Tofu On A Tray And Bake In The Oven For 8 Minutes.
6. Toast The Sesame Seeds In A Dry Frying Pan Over A High Heat For 1 Minute Or Until Golden, Then Tip Onto A Small Plate.
7. Cool The Rice. When The Rice Is Cooked, Take It Off The Heat And Mix In 1.5 Tbsp Of Rice Wine Vinegar, ½ A Tsp Of Salt, ½ A Tsp Of Sugar And Most Of The Toasted Sesame Seeds, Saving A Sprinkle For Garnishing. Spread The Rice Onto A Plate And Leave To Cool, Then Divide Into 4 Equal Portions.
8. After 8 Minutes, Take The Tofu Out Of The Oven And Coat With Half Of The Peanut Sauce. Bake For Another 10 Minutes Then Remove From The Oven And Slice Each Strip In Half Lengthways.
9. Start Rolling! Place A Small Bowl Of Water Nearby. Lay 2 Layers Of Clingfilm Larger Than The Nori Sheet Over Your Clean Chopping Board. Place The Nori On Top Of The Clingfilm In Portrait Orientation. Using Your Hands, Take One Portion Of Rice And Spread It Evenly Onto The Half Of The Nori Sheet Closest To You, Leaving A 1Cm Gap At The Edge Of The Sheet. Wet Your Fingertips To Stop The Rice Sticking To Your Hands.
10. Place Your Strips Of Tofu With A Portion Of Avocado And Carrots Horizontally In The Centre Of The Rice. Drizzle A Little Of The Peanut Sauce Over The Filling, Then Start Rolling The Sushi By Placing Your Thumbs Underneath The Clingfilm And Lifting The Edge That Is Closest To You Up And Over The Filling In The Centre. Curve The Rest Of Your Fingers Over The Clingfilm And Gently Press Against The Length Of The Roll, Squeezing The Rice And Filling Together Inside. Continue To Roll The Sushi Away From You Until You’Ve Rolled Past The Furthest Edge Of The Nori Sheet. You May Need To Use A Little Water To Seal The Edge. Repeat Until You Get 4 Sushi Rolls.
11. Use A Sharp Knife To Cut Each Roll In Half, Then Each Half Into 3 Equal Pieces. Rinse Under The Tap Between Slices To Help Get A Clean Cut. Garnish The Sushi Rolls With A Sprinkling Of The Reserved Sesame Seeds And Serve With The Remaining Soy Sauce For Dipping.

Flip Them Repeatedlyafter About 8 Minutes To Let Them Brown Evenly. They Stay Softfor A Long Time And Don’T Start To Brown Till The End. Afterabout 30 Minutes They Should Be Done, You Can Take Them Outwhen They Have The Desired Colour.
5. Like Most Seitan ‘Meats’ They’Re Best After Coolingcompletely. Fresh Out Of The Pan The Crust Is A Little Hard,It Will Soften After Cooling While The Inside Gets Firmer.They’Re Perfect After A Night In The Fridge. You Can Reheatthem In A Pan Or In Hot Gravy.

3. If Serving With Roasted Veg, Prep And Put In Oven Alongside The Pepper. Crunchy Veg Will Take Longer Than The Pepper To Roast So Timing Should Be About Spot On.

5. While The Pasta Is Cooking, Finely Chop Your Onions And Garlic And Add To A Big Pan With Oil. Cook Until Nicely Softened But Not Brown. If Using Carrot, Also Chop Finely And Add Alongside The Onions And Garlic. Cook Until Carrot Is Soft.
6. Scrape Down The Pan And Add The Onion And Garlic Mix To The Blender, Along With The Rest Of The Ingredients (Don’T Add The Yeast Last Or You Will Lose Some Of It When It Whizzes Around). If Using The Pepper, This Is When You Add It. (Remove As Much Of The Skin As You Can Before Doing So And Exclude All Pips And The Stalk.)
7. You Now Need To Blend Until Lovely And Smooth. This Will Take At Least Three Or Four Goes Depending On Your Blender. Scrape Down The Sides In Between Blends To Make Sure Everything Is Incorporated.

2. You Will Also Need:
3. – 8 Inch X 8 Inch Greaseproof Baking Dish.
4. Preparing The Seitan:
5. Combine The First 5 Dry Ingredients And Set To One Side.
6. To The Cold Vegetable Stock, Add The Soy Sauce And Peanut Butter. Whisk Together Well.
7. Make A Well In The Centre Of The Dry Ingredients, Add The Liquid And Bring Together. You May Need To Use A Spoon Or Spatula To Combine Initially But Once It Forms A Dough The Best Thing To Do Is Just Get Stuck In With Your Hands.
8. Kneed The Dough In The Bowl For 10 Minutes Or So Until It Toughens Up And Holds Its Shape. Let It Rest For 10 Minutes Then Kneed Again For A Further 5-10 Minutes.

12. Marinating And Cooking The Seitan:
13. This Recipe Works Best If You Can Prepare It The Day Before And Leave Time For The Seitan To Marinate In The Sauce Overnight. However, If You’Re Pushed For Time Then Marinating For 4 Hours Or So Should Suffice.
14. Once The Seitan Has Cooled, Slice Into Strips And Add To A Fresh Dish Large Enough To Accommodate The Marinade.
15. To Marinate, Take Half Of The Prepared Sauce, Add 50Ml Of Water To Thin It Out And Cover The Seitan Strips. Cover With Cling Film And Pop It In The Fridge.
16. To Cook The Strips, Once They Have Marinated For As Long As You Have Time To Allow, Add Them To A Heated Frying Pan Along With The Marinade And Fry On Medium-High For 10 Minutes.
17. Turn The Strips Over Regularly To Ensure Even Cooking And Add The Remaining Half Of The Sauce. Lower To Heat To Medium And Continue Cooking For A Further 5 – 10 Minutes To Heat Through The Sauce. Be Sure To Continue Turning The Strips Every Few Minutes For Even Cooking.

If You Don’T Have An Immersion Blender, Transfer The Mixture To A Regular Blender And Puree (Don’T Overprocess!), Then Transfer Back To The Soup Pot. Add Enough Nondairy Milk To Give The Soup A Medium-Thick Consistency.

17. Apricot Preserve Warmed And Sieved","1. To Make The Most Of Fruits In Season Check The Helpful Guides From Eat Seasonably And What’S In Season. Celebrate Fruits At Their Very Best, Full Of Flavour And Nutrients And Produced In Harmony With The Environment.
2. To Achieve The Best Results When Making Pastry, Everything Needs To Be As Cool As Possible, Including Your Kitchen. You Can Even Pre-Chill Your Flour And The Bowl You’Ll Be Using!
3. Sieve The Flour And Sugar Into The Bowl And Add The Cubes Of Vegan Margarine. Rub The Fat Into The Flour Using Your Fingertips, Working Quickly And With A Light Touch To Avoid The Fat Melting, Until The Mixture Resembles Fine Breadcrumbs. Check For Any Remaining Lumps Of Margarine By Shaking The Bowl To Bring Them To The Surface.
4. Make A Well In The Centre Of The Mixture And Add The Chilled Water, A Little At A Time. Lightly Work The Mixture To Form A Ball, Adding A Sprinkle Of Flour If The Mixture Is Too Wet, Or A Touch More Water If It’S Too Dry.
5. Allow The Pastry To ‘Rest’ In The Fridge For 20-30 Minutes Prior To Using It.
6. Roll Out The Pastry On A Floured Surface, Then Line A 9” Greased Flan Tin And Return To The Fridge For A Further 30 Minutes To Chill, As This Should Help Prevent The Pastry From Shrinking.
7. Pre-Heat The Oven To 190ºc/375ºf/Gas Mark 5.
8. Bake The Pastry Case ‘Blind’ (Partially Baking Pastry Before Adding A Wet Filling, To Avoid Making It Soggy). Prick Over With A Fork, Line With Greaseproof Paper And Fill With Ceramic Baking Beans, Dried Pulses Or Uncooked Rice.
9. Bake For About 15 Minutes Or Until The Pastry Starts To Become A Light Golden Brown. Remove The Paper And Beans, Then Return To The Oven For A Couple Of Minutes. Remove The Pastry Case From The Oven And Allow To Cool.
10. In The Meantime Make The Fruit Filling. Wash And Prepare The Fruit By Either Trimming The Rhubarb, Stoning The Cherries Or Plums Or Coring The Apples. Reserve The Most Attractive Fruits For Decorating The Top.
11. Cut The Remainder Into Small Pieces And Simmer In A Pan Over A Gentle Heat With The Margarine, Sugar Or Syrup, A Splash Of Water And The Optional Lemon Juice And Cinnamon Until Soft And Pulpy. In The Unlikely Event That The Mixture Is Far Too Wet, Simply Remove Any Excess Juice And Thicken The Fruit Pulp With A Little Cornflour Or Tapioca Flour. Remove From The Heat And Allow To Cool, Then Use To Cover The Base Of The Pastry Case.
12. Cut The Reserved Fruit Accordingly – The Rhubarb Into Pieces, The Cherries And Plums Into Halves And The Apples Into Slices – And Arrange Neatly On Top. If Necessary, Brush The Apple Slices With A Little Lemon Juice To Prevent Them From Browning. They Look Great Laid In Concentric Circles, Each Slice Overlapping The Last! If You Like, You Can Also Brush The Fruit With A Little Melted Vegan Margarine And Sprinkle With Cinnamon.
13. Bake For 25 Minutes At 180ºc/350ºf/Gas Mark 4. If You Want To Brown The Edges Of The Fruit, Just Flash The Tart Under A Hot Grill.
14. For A Really Quick And Easy Glaze, Brush The Tart Over With The Warmed, Sieved Apricot Preserve.
15. Serve The Tart Warm Or At Room Temperature. For An Extra Finishing Touch, Lightly Dust With Icing Sugar And Serve With Plain Soya Yogurt Which Has Been Strained And Flavoured With A Little Vanilla And Cardamom.
16. Alternatively, You Could Indulge In Some Delicious Booja Booja ‘Icecream’ Which Is Based On Cashew Nuts And Agave Nectar.

Place Between Sheets Of Kitchen Paper On A Plate And Freeze. Remove From The Freezer A Couple Of Hours Before You Want To Start Cooking, In Order To Defrost.
2. Heat The Oven To 200°C / 400°F / Gas Mark 6.
3. Once The Tofu Has Defrosted, Press Between Sheets Of Kitchen Paper Until Most Of The Water Has Gone (You Can Do This Using A Heavy Book). You Don’T Want The Tofu To Be So Dry That It Crumbles, But Just To Remove Most Of The Water.
4. Combine The Ingredients For The Tofu Coating ‘Batter’ In A Bowl.
5. Dip Each Tofu Wing Into The Batter To Fully Coat And Place On A Non-Stick Baking Tray, Greased With A Little Oil If Needed.
6. Place On The Top Shelf Of The Oven And Cook For 30 Minutes, Turning Once Half Way Through.
7. Next, Put The Bbq Sauce On To Simmer. Combine All The Ingredients And Cook On A Medium Heat On The Hob, Covering With A Lid Once It Starts To Bubble And Spit. You Want A Thick Sauce, So Simmer For 20-30 Minutes.
8. While The Wings And Bbq Sauce Are Cooking, Make The Ranch. Put All The Ingredients Into A Food Processor And Blitz Until Smooth.
9. Once The Wings Have Been Cooking For 30 Minutes, Remove From The Oven. Carefully Place Each One In The Bbq Sauce, Coat Using A Spoon, Then Place Back Onto The Baking Tray.
10. Cook For A Further 10 Minutes, Arrange On A Plate With The Ranch And Serve!
11. Notes:Freezing The Tofu Isn’T Essential, But It Leads To A Chewier Texture. If You’Re Not Freezing It, Drain And Press For A Little Longer, Ensuring As Much Water Is Squeezed Out As Possible.

4. Add 175Ml (6 Floz) Of The Water And Mix Thoroughly With The Dry Ingredients. Add The Remaining 25Ml Of Water A Little At A Time, Until You Have A Dough-Like ‘Rollable’ Ball (The Best Way To Mix Is To Use The Back Of A Spoon, With A Pressing Type Motion Or Just Get Your Hands In There). When You Have Added All Water Necessary, Press Firmly Together With Your Hands. You May Be Tempted To Add More Water To Get It To Bind, But Make Sure That You Really Need It First, Otherwise You’Ll End Up With A Soggy Mix! If You Put Too Much Water In It’S Not Really A Problem Though, Just Add Extra Oatmeal Or Spelt Flour.

2. Top Tofu Tip!Before We Get Started It’S Probably Worth Sharing My Number 1 Favourite Tip For Tofu – Freeze It First, Then Defrost It.
3. Whilst This Means A Little More Planning, It Seems To Make A Big Difference In The Firmness, How Easy It Is To Work With, And Also The Texture Of The End Result. It’S Not The End Of The World If You Haven’T Time To Freeze It Before Using But For Future Reference, I Find It Works Best To Keep Tofu In The Freezer And Just Take It Out To Defrost The Evening Before Or The Morning Of The Day I’M Going To Be Using It
4. Unpackage The Tofu And Drain Well, Squeezing The Excess Moisture Over The Sink Before Placing In A Clean Tea Cloth
5. Wrap The Cloth Around The Tofu And Press Down On It To Remove As Much Of The Moisture As Possible – I Find Placing It Between Two Chopping Boards Is A Good
6. Cut The Tofu Into Cubes – I Find Slicing It In Half Into Two Flat Slabs Is A Good Way To Start
7. Place The Tofu In A Bowl, Add The Salt, Pepper, Spices, And Soy Sauce And Mix Gently Until All Pieces Are Evenly Coated
8. Add The Flour And Mix Again, Until Evenly Coated

20. Salt And Freshly Ground Black Pepper","1. Preheat The Oven To 200°C/180°C Fan/Gas Mark 6.
2. First, Make The Coconut Paste. Using A Food Processor Or Stick Blender, Blitz The Spring Onions, Green Chilli, Coriander Stalks, Garlic, Ginger, Turmeric And Cumin And Coriander Seeds With Half The Can Of Coconut Milk Until A Rough Paste Forms.
3. Bring A Large Saucepan Of Water To The Boil, Lower In The Potatoes And Boil Or 15 Minutes Or Until A Sharp Knife Passes Through Them Easily. Drain And Set Aside.
4. Place The Cauliflower In A Deep Roasting Tin And Pour The Remaining Coconut Milk Around It. Scatter The Kaffir Lime Leaves Over The Coconut Milk. Rub 1 Tablespoon Of The Coconut Oil Over The Cauliflower And Season Well With Salt And Pepper. Then Use A Spatula Or Spoon To Rub The Spice Paste All Over The Cauliflower, Getting Into Every Crevice Of Each Floret. Squeeze The Lime Juice Over The Cauliflower. Cover The Tin Tightly With Foil, Place On The Middle Shelf Of The Oven And Roast The Cauliflower For 20 Minutes.
5. Meanwhile, Heat The Remaining 3 Tablespoons Coconut Oil In A Separate Shallow Roasting Tin On The Top Shelf Of The Oven Above The Cauliflower For A Couple Of Minutes. Carefully Remove The Tin From The Oven, Arrange The Potatoes In A Single Even Layer In The Hot Oil And Use A Potato Masher To Press Down On Them Just To Split Their Skins.

11. 2 Cloves Garlic Chopped Finely
12. Zest Of A Lemon
13. A Large Handful Of Parsleyor A Selection Of Herbs That You Like
14. 1 Tbsp Capers
15. 4 Tbsps Extra Virgin Olive Oil
16. Salt And Pepper","1. Soup:
2. Pre Heat The Oven To 200C/ Gas Mark 6.
3. Peel The Celeriac Using A Sharp Peeler And Remove Any Areas Where The Roots Are Still Visible.
4. Chop Into 1 Cm Cubes And Place In A Roasting Tin With A Splash Of Rapeseed Or Vegetable Oil.
5. Roast The Celeriac For 25 Minutes Or Until It Is Softened And Golden Around The Edges. Add The Caraway Seeds And Return To The Oven For Another Five Minutes.
6. While The Celeriac Is Roasting Heat A Little Oil In A Large Sauce Pan And Gently Cook The Onion, Until It Is Really Soft And Starting To Caramelise. Add The Garlic And Fry For Another 5 Minutes.
7. Add The Roasted Celeriac, Bouquet Garniand Caraway To The Onion Mixture And Stir Well.
8. Pour On The Stock And Soya Milk And Simmer For 5 Minutes.
9. Remove The Bouquet Garni And Blend Until Smooth With A Hand Blender. Taste, Season And Serve
10. Tip: A Bouquet Garni Is A Small Bunch Of Herbs That You Add To Soups And Stews To Infuse The Dish With Flavour-It Is Removed Before Serving. Traditionally The Herbs Are “Hard Herbs” Such As Bay, Rosemary, Sage, Thyme, All Of Which Grow Well In The British Winter. You Can Tie Them Together With Clean String (You Can Buy Cooking String From Kitchen Shops) Or Use A Heatproof Plastic Freezer Clip-One That Has Been Washed In A Hot Dishwasher Or Placed In Boiling Water Before Use To Sterilise.
11. Croutons:
12. Preheat The Oven To 200C/ Gas Mark 6
13. Heat A Roasting Dish In The Oven. Add The Oil And Then The Bread And Mix Well.
14. Cook In The Oven For Approximately 10 Minutes And Then Add The Chopped Garlic And Stir In. Return To The Oven And Roast For Another 5-10 Minutes, Stirring Occasionally So That The Bread Is Crispy And Golden.
15. Finely Chop The Herbs And Capers Together With The Lemon Zest.
16. Add The Chopped Herbs To The Crispy Croutons And Mix Together. Taste And Add Pepper (You Probably Won’T Need Salt As The Capers Are Salty Already)
17. Use To Garnish The Soup-Any Leftovers Can Be Stored In An Airtight Box In The Fridge And Will Keep For About 3 Days.
18. Tips: These Croutons Are A Great Way Of Using Up Stale Bread-They Are Traditionally Made With Sourdough Or Ciabatta Style Bread. You Can Also Use A Wheat Free Or Spelt Bread. Croutons On Their Own (Without Added Herbs) Will Keep For Weeks In A Sealed Container Out Of The Fridge-Once You Add Fresh Herbs They Won’T Last So Long And Need To Be Kept Cold. If You Like Things Spicy Add Some Flaked Chilli To The Croutons. Croutons Don’T Need To Be Just For Soup-They Are Also Great Added To Pasta Dishes, Rice Or Salads. Vary The Herbs That You Use – Parsley Is Ideal But Basil, Chives, Dill, Sorrel And Coriander Would Also Work.",98,9,"3,9",6,Main Course,Dinner,1,https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/VCS-EatPictures-WebRes-3362.jpg,roasted-celeriac-and-caraway-soup-with-herb-and-caper-croutons

3. Place The Remaining 50Ml Of Plant Milk In A Small Bowl And Add The Cornstarch And Turmeric Powder. Whisk Well Until Smooth And No Lumps Remain.
4. Gradually Whisk The Cornstarch Mixture Into The Warmed Plant Milk. Keep Whisking Constantly Over Low Heat Until The Mixture Thickens Dramatically. Once Thickened, Leave The Mixture To Bubble A Couple Of Times Before Removing From The Heat And Vigorously Whisking In The Vegan Butter.
5. Pour The Custard Into A Baking Tray (This Will Allow It To Cool More Quickly) And Cover With Cling Film, Making Sure The Film Is Making Contact With The Surface Of The Custard.
6. Once Cooled To Room Temperature, Refrigerate The Custard For A Minimum Of 20 Minutes.
7. To Peel The Peaches
8. If Using Fresh Peaches Rather Than Canned, Fill A Large Bowl With Ice Cold Water.

16. 1 12 Cups Water Warmed To Between 110120 Degrees F
17. 2 Teaspoons Agave Nectar
18. 4 Teaspoons Active Dry Yeast
19. 3 12 Cups Whole Wheat Flour
20. 1 Teaspoon Salt
21. 2 Teaspoons Vital Wheat Gluten","1. Homemade Veggie Burgers Can Be A Challenge To Some! Vegetable Patties Can Be Cooked By Baking, Frying, Or Grilling. For This Recipe, I Formed The Patties The Night Before And Then Froze Them In Order To Make Them Grillable. This Actually Worked Really Well. Note, However, That I Grilled Them In A Grill Pan, Not On An Outdoor Grill. Your Results May Vary.
2. To Make The Patties, Combine One Half Of The Beans And One Half Of The Rice In A Food Processor. Add The Oil And Salsa And Process Until Mostly Smooth. Combine With The Remaining Ingredients In A Large Bowl And Mix Well. Form Into 8 Patties With Your Hands. I Roughly Measured Them As 1/3 Cup Of Patty Mix Each. Wrap In Waxed Paper Or Parchment Paper And Let Freeze In A Container Or On A Flat Surface In A Plastic Bag.
3. To Make The Bitty Burger Buns, Combine The Warm Water, Agave, And Yeast And Whisk Until Combined, Just A Few Seconds. Let Stand 10 Minutes Until Proofed. Combine With The Remaining Ingredients And Mix Until Dough Forms. Knead Until Smooth. Add More Flour If Too Sticky. I Added An Additional Two Tablespoons. I Also Used My Standing Mixer For This, Using The Dough Hook Of Course. I Let The Machine Knead The Dough For 3-4 Minutes. If Kneading By Hand You May Be Looking At 5-7 Minutes Instead. Roll To A 1/2 Inch Thickness, Then Cut With A Biscuit Cutter Into 12-16 Rounds.
4. Sprinkle Cornmeal On A Couple Of Cookie Sheets. Place The Buns On The Cookie Sheets. Cover With A Towel And Let Rise In A Warm Place For One Hour. Bake At 375 Degrees For 10-12 Minutes, Until Browned On Top.
5. When Ready For The Burgers, Lightly Oil A Non-Stick Grill Pan. Preheat Over Medium High Heat. Cook Each Patty For 5-7 Minutes, Pushing Down With A Spatula Occasionally For Nice Grill Marks. Gently Flip And Cook For The Same Amount Of Time On The Other Side.
6. You Don’T Have To Make All Of The Patties At Once. Just Keep Them In The Refrigerator Until You’Re Ready For Another!

4. Fill A Bowl With Slightly Warm Water. The Diameter Of The Bowl Needs To Be Wider Than The Rice Paper So That The Rice Paper Can Be Fully Immersed In The Water.
5. Dunk One Rice Paper In The Bowl Of Water For 5 Seconds. Give It A Shake To Get Rid Of Excess Water And Lay On A Clean Chopping Board.
6. Near One Of The Edges Of The Paper Place A Handful Or Two Of The Watercress Tearing Any Larger Clumps Into Smaller Sections As The Rolls Are Meant To Be Eaten By Hand.

2. Black Rice – I’Ve Been Obsessed With This Ever Since I Was Introduced To It By Jane, And I Love The Fact That It Has Bite And Is Really Easy To Cook. 1 Part Rice To 2 Parts Water, Bring To Boil, Turn Down And Simmer For 40 Minutes. Works Perfectly Every Time. I Buy The Biona Black Rice, But You Should Be Able To Find It In Most Supermarkets.
3. Refried Beans – I’Ve Been A Refried Bean Fan Ever Since I Was A Kid. Great In Nachos As Well, But Lovely Here Because Of Their Creamy Flavour. You Buy It In Cans, And You’Ll Find Them In The Mexican Section.
4. Guacamole – I Always Make My Own, As It Is So Much Tastier, Really Easy And Doesn’T Have Any Sour Cream Sneaked In (Many Store-Made Guacs Do, So Always Check The Label Before You Buy). My ‘Go-To’ Recipe Is This:
5. Mash Up 2 Ripe Avocados With A Fork
6. Finely Dice Some Red Onion (About Half A Small One) And A Stalk Of Spring Onion – Add To Bowl
7. Finely Dice One Red Chilli (Up To You If You Keep The Seeds Or Not!) – Add To Bowl
8. Chop Up About 6-8 Cherry Tomatoes Into Little Pieces (In Half And Then In Half Again At Least) – Add To Bowl
9. Squeeze In The Juice Of About Half A Lemon – Do This To Taste. You Can Always Add More Lemon, So Start Off With A Little First
10. Salt And Cracked Pepper
11. If You Don’T Have Any Fresh Chilli Then You Can Use A Hot Sauce, Like Tabasco, Instead. And If You’Re Not Keen On Heat, Then Just Leave The Chilli Out Altogether.

2. Block About 4 Oz Extrafirm Waterpacked Tofu Pressed
3. Tsp Kala Namak Himalayan Black Salt
4. 2 Cups Water
5. 2 And  Tsp Agar Powder Or 3 T Agar Flakes
6. Ingredients : For The Yolk Filling
7. Block About 8 Oz Extrafirm Waterpacked Tofu Pressed
8. 3 Tbsp Vegan Mayonnaise
9. 1 Tbsp Nutritional Yeast Flakes
10. 1 Tbsp Dill Pickle Brine
11. 2 Tsp Dijon Mustard Or Spicy Golden Mustard

15. Tsp Paprika For Extra Bedeviling Use Cayenne Pepper
16. Garnishes
17. Paprika And Coarse Ground Black Pepper
18. Optional Sliced Black Olives Fresh Snipped Chives Capers Chopped Cornichons Chopped Dill","1. A Blender Is Required For Preparing The “Egg Whites” And A Food Processor Is Recommended For The “Yolk Filling”. You Will Also Need An 8” Square Baking Pan And 1 Block (14 Oz) Of Extra-Firm Water-Packed Tofu. If You Have Chocolate Egg Molds, Or A Heat-Proof Container That Specifically Holds Deviled Eggs, The “Egg White” Mixture Can Be Poured Into The Molds To Create Perfect, Halved Hard-Boiled Egg Shapes. This Recipe Yields 16 To 24 Bedeviled Eggless Eggs, Or More Depending Upon The Mold(S) Used For The “Egg Whites”.
2. Drain And Press The Tofu Until It Is Not Releasing Any More Liquid – This Is Very Important! After Pressing You Will Have Approximately 12 Oz Of Tofu. Slice ⅓ Of The Tofu To Use For The “Egg Whites. The Remaining ⅔ Will Be Used For The “Yolk” Filling.
3. To Prepare The “Egg Whites”, Place The “Egg White” Ingredients Into A Blender And Process Until Smooth. Pour The Mixture Into A Saucepan And Bring To Rapid Simmer Over Medium Heat, Stirring Frequently To Avoid Scorching The Tofu Mixture. Pour The Mixture Into The 8” Baking Pan And Set Aside To Cool. If You Have Chocolate Egg Molds, Or A Heat-Proof Container That Specifically Holds Deviled Eggs, Pour The Tofu Mixture Directly Into The Molds And Set Aside To Cool.
4. Next, Crumble The ⅔ Block Of Pressed Tofu Into The Food Processor And Add The Remaining “Yolk” Filling Ingredients. Process The Contents Until Completely Smooth, Stopping As Necessary To Scrape Down The Sides Of The Food Processor. Alternately, The Mixture Can Be Mashed Using A Fork Or A Potato Masher/Ricer, But The Mixture Will Not Be As Smooth.
5. Transfer The “Yolk” Mixture To A Bowl Or Food Storage Container, Season With Additional Kala Namak If Desired, Cover And Refrigerate Until Ready To Use. Cover The Baking Pan With Plastic Wrap Or Foil And Refrigerate Until The “Egg Whites” Have Completely Set, Or A Minimum Of 30 Minutes.
6. Now, Run A Table Knife Around The Perimeter Of The Baking Pan To Loosen The “Egg White” (Or Simply Pop Them Out Of The Chocolate Egg Molds). Invert The Baking Pan Onto A Clean Work Surface. At This Point, The “Egg White” Can Be Cut Into Rectangles Or Cut Into Rounds Or Ovals.
7. For Rectangles, Cut The “Egg Whites” Into 6 Even Strips. Turn Your Cutting Surface And Make 4 Even Slices. This Will Create 24 Rectangles. For Rounds Or Ovals, Use A 1 And ½-Inch To 1 And ¾-Inch Cookie Cutter Or Ring Mold. Any “Egg White” Remnants Can Be Finely Diced And Mixed With Any Of The Leftover “Yolk” Filling For A Quick Eggless Egg Salad Sandwich.
8. Spoon A Generous Teaspoonful Of The “Yolk” Mixture Onto The Top Of Each “Egg White”. Alternately, The Mixture Can Be Decoratively Piped Onto The “Egg Whites” Using A Pastry Bag. If You Don’T Have A Pastry Bag, Try Placing The Mixture Into A Zip-Lock Bag, Seal And Then Snip Off A Tiny Piece From The Bottom Corner Of The Bag With Scissors. Squeeze The Bag To Pipe The Mixture Onto The “Egg Whites”.
9. Sprinkle With Paprika And Garnish With Optional Ingredients As Desired. Cover Gently With Plastic Wrap And Chill Thoroughly Before Serving.","352,5",8,9,32,Main Course,Dinner,0,https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Egg1-1200x900.jpg,bedeviled-eggless-eggs

2. Add The Cider Vinegar, Soya Sauce, Liquid Smoke, Tomato Paste, And A Little Of The Stock. Different Brands Of Wheat Gluten Need Different Amounts Of Stock So Be Cautious At First. You Can Always Add But You Can’T Take Away.
3. Mix Well With A Wooden Spoon, Adding A Little Stock As You Go Until It Comes Together. You Want It To Be Moist But It Requires Kneading Too So It Can’T Be Too Wet. If You Add Too Much Stock, You Can Always Add More Wheat Gluten.
4. Once It Has All Come Together, Knead The Dough For 5 Minutes. You Should Start To See Some Stringy Bits Forming. That Is The Gluten Developing.
5. Once You Have Done That, Divide Out The Dough In To Equal Portions. This Should Make 4 But You Can Do More Or Less, Depending On How Big You Want Them To Be.
6. Roll Each Piece In To A Rough Sausage Shape And Then Wrap In Tin Foil And Fold Or Twist The Ends Shut. I Usually Lightly Oil The Tin Foil, Just In Case They Stick. Make Sure You Go Around The Sausage A Couple Of Times Otherwise They Can Burst. You Don’T Have To Do It Too Tightly, The Sausage Will Expand To Fill The Space.
7. Once You Have Them All Rolled Up, Put Them In A Steamer For 45 Mins. If You Made Lots Of Thin Sausages, 35 – 40 Mins Should Be Fine. If You Made Really Large Sausages Then You Want To Be More Like 55 – 60 Mins. I Turned Mine Over Halfway Through The Steaming As Well.
8. Once They Have Steamed, Let Them Cool Without Opening The Packages. Put Them In The Fridge Where They Will Become More Solid Over A Few Hours. They Last A Week Or Two In The Fridge If You Don’T Open Them.

2. Pour Cooking Oil Into A Pan And Add 1 Pack Of Sushi Nori Sheets To Infuse The Oil. The Longer You Leave Them In The Better: E.G. You Could Soak Them In The Morning And Then Cook The Vegan Fish Fingers In The Evening For A More Intense Taste. Alternatively, If You Don’T Have Much Time Heat Them Up A Bit For 5 Minutes So They Give Up More Flavour. Make Sure The Heat Isn’T Too High Because They Burn Easily.
3. Step 2:
4. Place Ingredients Of Step 2 Into A Food Processor Until You Get A Semi-Smooth Mixture.
5. Step 3:
6. Transfer The Mixture Into A Large Bowl And Add All Other Ingredients From This Step And Mix. Make Sure There Are No Chickpea Flour Lumps, Otherwise The Fish Fingers Might Taste Bitter.
7. Form Fish Finger Shapes. Alternatively, Just Form Sausage Shapes. Admittedly It Was A Bit Of Work To Make Rectangular Shapes And When They Were Fried They Lost Their Shape A Bit Anyway. So If You Want To Make Your Life Easier, Roll Them Into A Sausage Shape, It Won’T Make A Difference In Terms Of Taste. They Will Be Quite Soft At This Stage, But Don’ Worry They Will Firm Up When Fried.
8. Step 4:
9. Add Breadcrumbs To A Bowl And Roll The Vegan Fish Fingers In Them Until They Are Covered On All Sides.

19. 46 Cups Brown Rice Flour Divided Plus More For Dusting","1. Combining Quintessential Autumnal Flavors—Sage, Maple Syrup, Cinnamon—With An Array Of Multi-Colored Root Vegetables, This Perfect Fall Entrée Is Sophisticated Comfort Food At Its Finest. While The Combination Of Root Vegetables Produces An Aesthetically Striking Dish, It Does Complicate The Process A Bit. If You’D Like To Make The Recipe Simpler, Simply Use One Root Vegetable Instead Of All Six.
2. Preheat The Oven To 400°F.
3. Wrap The Beets, Sweet Potato, Celeriac, Parsnip, And Turnip Each Individually In Aluminum Foil And Place On A Baking Sheet. Place The Butternut Squash, Face-Down, On The Baking Sheet, As Well. Roast All Of The Veggies For 45-60 Minutes Until You Can Pierce Through Them With A Fork. Remove From The Oven And Let Sit Until Cool Enough To Handle.
4. Meanwhile, Make The Pesto. Heat The Coconut Oil Over Medium-High Heat. When The Oil Shimmers, Add The Shallots And Sage. Sauté For 5-10 Minutes, Or Until Golden Brown. Add The Sauté To A Food Processor Along With The Rest Of The Pesto Ingredients, Except For The Olive Oil. Pulse Until Well Combined, Scraping Down The Sides As Necessary. As The Motor Is Running, Drizzle In Olive Oil To Achieve The Desired Consistency.
5. Set A Large Pot Of Salted Water To Boil.
6. Once The Veggies Have Cooled, Puree Each Of Them Separately In A Food Processor(Or Mash Them Separately With A Potato Masher) And Place The Purees Into Separate Bowls. Make Sure That You Process The Beets Last So As Not To Stain The Other Veggie Purees With A Magenta Hue. Combine The Purees Of Celeriac, Turnip, And Parsnip. You’Ll Have Four Bowls Of Puree In Front Of You: One Deep Orange(Butternut Squash), One Light Orange(Sweet Potato), One Magenta(Beet), And One White(Celeriac, Turnip, And Parsnip). Combine Each Of The Purees With 1 Cup Of Brown Rice Flour, Adding More To Each Bowl To Achieve An Ever-So-Slightly Sticky Consistency(The Butternut Squash And Sweet Potato Purees Will Require Less Than The Others).
7. Dust A Work Surface With Additional Flour. Divide Each Dough Into Two Portions And Roll Them Into Snakes About 1/2-Inch In Width. Cut Each Snake Into 10-20 Gnocchi And Place In A Single Layer On A Baking Sheet.
8. Once The Pot Of Water Is Boiling, Drop The Gnocchi—Ten At A Time And Only With Gnocchi Of Like Color—Into The Pot. Cook Until The Gnocchi Floats To The Top, About 30 Seconds. Remove The Gnocchi From The Water And Place In A Colander Sitting Over A Bowl To Allow The Water To Drain.

25. 100G Basil Pesto Tofu Available In Supermarkets Sliced
26. 34 Tbsp Nutritional Yeast","1. Remove The Leaves From The Cauliflower And Cut Into Chunks. Then Using A Blender Or Food Processor, Blitz The Cauliflower Until It Is Finely Chopped So That It Resembles Rice, I.E. Cauliflower Crumb
2. Transfer The Crumb Into A Steamer And Steam For 15 Mins Or Microwave In A Bowl With Cling-Film (With A Hole Or Two On Top) For 6 Mins Until Soft
3. Preheat The Oven To 200ºc (180ºc Fan). Line 2 Large Baking Sheets With Greaseproof Paper And A Little Coconut Spray Oil
4. Allow The Cooked Cauliflower Crumb To Cool Before Transferring Into A Clean Tea Towel And Squeezing As Much Moisture As You Can Out. (Really Wring It!) You May Need More Than One Tea Towel
5. Transfer The Dehydrated Cauliflower Crumb Into A Bowl And Add The Remaining Pizza Base Ingredients: Ground Chia Seeds, Protein Powder (I Used Pulsin Soya Protein Powder), Ground Almonds, Nutritional Yeast, Chia Egg Substitute, Dried Mixed Herbs, A Large Pinch Of Salt And Plenty Of Freshly Ground Black Pepper

12. I Love To Serve Mine With A Large Handful Of Fresh Rocket On Top And A Side Salad. Enjoy!
13. The Key To Making A Great Cauliflower Crust Pizza Is By Making A Cauliflower Crumb And Then Dehydrating It, So That As Much Moisture Is Squeezed Out As Possible, Allowing The Remaining Crumb To Be Turned Into A Crispy Pizza Base. (If You Don’T Squeeze Out The Moisture, The Base Will Be All Soggy). You Will Be Surprised With The Amount Of Liquid Which Comes Out! But This Delicious Grain-Free Pizza Is Well Worth The Effort.
14. There Are Two Ways You Can Dehydrate Your Cauliflower Crumb: The More Time-Consuming  Is By Putting The Cooked Cauliflower Crumb In A Tea-Towel Or Two And Wringing Out The Moisture. (I Think Of This As Stress Relief!). Alternatively, If You Are Lucky Enough To Have A Juicer, You Can Simply Feed Cauliflower Florets Through The Juicer And Collect The Residual Crumb And Mix This Directly With The Remaining Pizza Base Ingredients. (No Need To Cook Before Using!).
15. So Why Not Give This Recipe A Go, To Create A Delicious Vegan Pizza Chock Full Of Vegetables!

9. Tsp Bluegreen Algae Powder Spirulina","1. For This Cheese You Will Need A Glass, Ceramic, Metal Or Bpa-Free Plastic Container Which Will Hold A Minimum Of 1 And ½ Cup Liquid; This Will Act As The Form To Shape The Cheese. This Recipe Yields About 8 Ounces.
2. Line The Form With Plastic Wrap Or A Double-Layer Of Cheesecloth, Being Sure To Leave Some Excess Hanging Over The Sides. This Will Help Lift The Cheese From The Form After Firming.
3. Drain And Press The Tofu Until It Is Not Releasing Any More Liquid. It Is Essential To Dry The Tofu As Much As Possible For The Proper Texture. Crumble The Tofu Into A Food Processor.
4. Remove The Metal Lid From The Jar Of Coconut Oil And Place The Jar In A Microwave. Heat Just Until The Solid Oil Liquefies, About 30 Seconds To 1 Minute (This Will Depend Upon The Solidity Of The Coconut Oil). Alternately, Place The Jar In About An Inch Of Simmering Water And Melt The Oil In The Same Manner. Measure ¼ Cup And Add To The Food Processor With The Remaining Ingredients Except For The Algae Powder. Process The Contents Until Very Smooth.
5. Transfer The Cheese Mixture To A Bowl. Dot The Cheese In Several Spots With The Algae Powder And Fold (Rather Than Stir) The Cheese Over A Few Times To Create Swirls Of Blue-Green Color. Transfer The Cheese To The Lined Form. Pack The Mixture With The Back Of A Spoon And Smooth The Surface As Best You Can. Cover With Plastic Wrap And Refrigerate For A Minimum Of 8 Hours. This Will Ensure That The Coconut Oil Has Completely Solidified.
6. Lift The Cheese From The Container And Slice Or Crumble As Needed. Store The Cheese Wrapped In Plastic Wrap Or In A Zip-Lock Bag In The Refrigerator. Because This Cheese Is Made With Miso, A Fermented Product, The Flavor Will Continue To Develop As It Ages. Try Aging The Cheese For A Minimum Of One Week Before Using For The Best Flavor.

Blitz Together, Stopping Regularly To Scrape Down The Sides, Until You Have A Smooth And Creamy Consistency. You Can Do This In A Food Processor (The Smaller The Bowl The Better) But It Will Take You A Lot Longer And You May Find That The Final Result Is A Little Grainier Than It Should Be.

13. 2 Tb Unsweetened Almond Milk
14. 18 Tsp Salt","1. First, Preheat Your Oven To 350 Degrees. Then, Line 12 Spots In A Cupcake Tin With Paper Liners.
2. In A Small Bowl, Combine The Wet Ingredients: Almond Milk, Apple Cider Vinegar, Vanilla Extract, And Oil. Set Aside. You May Notice The Milk Will Start To Curdle, But Don’T Worry! It’S Suppose To.
3. In A Separate Medium-Sized Bowl, Combine The Dry Ingredients: Flour, Sugar, Baking Soda, Baking Powder, Salt. Stir Well.
4. Slowly Add The Wet Ingredients To The Dry Ingredients While Stirring. Make Sure All Flour Is Scraped From The Sides And Bottom Of The Bowl. Be Mindful To Not Over Mix.
5. Spoon The Batter Into The Cupcake Liners Just Until They Are About 3/4 Full. Use A Second Cupcake Tin With Extra Paper Liners, If Needed.
6. Bake On The Top Rack Of Your Preheated Oven For 19-20 Minutes Or Until A Toothpick Inserted Down The Center Of Each Cupcake Comes Out Clean With No Batter. Allow Them To Sit In The Tin For 5 Minutes Before Carefully Transferring Them To A Cooling Rack.
7. Cool Completely Before Frosting, About 1 1/2 – 2 Hours.
8. While The Cupcakes Cool, Use This Time To Make Your Frosting. Using An Electric Stand Or Hand Mixer, Cream The Shortening On A Medium Speed For About 30 Seconds.
9. Then, Add Half Of The Powdered Sugar And Half Of The Almond Milk And Mix On High For About 30 Seconds.
10. Next, Add The Salt And Remaining Sugar And Almond Milk. Mix On High Again For Another 30 Seconds. If You Feel The Frosting Should Be Slightly Thicker, Add A Spoonful Or So More Of Powdered Sugar. For Slightly Thinner Frosting, Add A Splash Or Two Of Almond Milk – But Be Careful – A Little Goes A Long Way!
11. Scrape Down The Sides Of The Bowl With A Spoon Or Spatula And Incorporate What Was Stuck To The Sides Into The Frosting.

2. 2 Tbsp Lemon Juice
3. 1 Tsp Sea Salt
4. Tbsp Apple Cider Vinegar
5. 1  2 Tbsp Nutritional Yeast
6. 13 Cup Refined Coconut Oil
7. This Recipe Only Works With Unsweetened Soya Milk
8. Use Refined Coconut Oil To Avoid Your Cheese Being Coconut Flavoured","1. Place A Sieve Over A Deep Pot Or Pan. Lay The Cheese Cloth In The Sieve. I Fold Mine So It’S Quadruple Thickness. (You Could Use A Thin, Clean Tea Towel If You Don’T Have Cheesecloth). This Is Where You Will Pour Your Milk To Make The Cheese When It Is Ready. It’S Important That Your Pot Is Deep So The Cheese Doesn’T Come Into Contact With The Liquid.
2. In A Large Pan, Over Medium-High Heat, Simmer The Soy Milk Until It Reaches A Light Boil. Stir Constantly With A Whisk And Watch The Milk Carefully So It Does Not Boil Over. It Is Important To Continue Stirring The Entire Time Your Milk Is On The Hob.
3. Once The Soy Milk Comes To A Light, Rolling Boil, Add The Lemon Juice And Stir. After About 30 Seconds You Should See Some Curdling Start To Occur (The Solid Of The Milk Will Start To Separate From The Liquids).
4. Add The Sea Salt. Turn Down The Heat And Stir For Another Minute Or So. At This Point Your Milk Should Be Really Curdled. You May See Chunks Or Your Curdled Milk May Be Of A Finer Grain Due To The Whisk.
5. Stir In The Nutritional Yeast (Dependent On How Cheesy You Want It To Taste) And Apple Cider Vinegar Into The Milk Mixture And Whisk Lightly.
6. Pour The Milk Over The Cheese Cloth. Be Careful Because The Milk Will Be Very Hot.
7. Tightly Tie The Cheesecloth At The Top. Place A Weight On Top Of The Cheese Cloth To Help It Drain Faster And The Cheese To Solidify. Anything Will Do Such As Cans Of Food Or A Stack Of Ramekins.
8. Place In The Fridge Overnight. In The Morning, The Whey Will Have Separated From The Milk Into The Bottom Bowl. Carefully Unwrap Your Cheese.
9. Melt The Coconut Oil (20-30 Seconds In The Microwave On High Will Do). Put The Cheese And Oil In A Blender And Blend For Around 30 Seconds. It Will Be Very Thick But You Just Want To Get An Even Texture. The Oil Gives The Cheese The Right ‘Mouth Feel’.

6. Spoon The Mixture Evenly Into The Cupcake Cases, Level The Tops And Bake In The Oven For 20 Minutes. Remove From The Oven And Transfer To A Wire Rack To Cool Completely.
7. Meanwhile, Make The Buttercream Icing. Place The Margarine, Rice Milk And Vanilla Extract Into A Mixing Bowl, Sift Over Half Of The Icing Sugar And Use An Electric Whisk To Mix The Ingredients Together. I Recommend Using An Electric Whisk As It Takes Some Time To Get The Icing Mixture To The Right Creamy Consistency – About 4 Minutes. By All Means Do It By Hand But It May Take You Much Longer. Sift In The Remaining Icing Sugar And Continue To Whisk Until Thick, Glossy And Creamy. Place The Icing In The Fridge To Chill Until Ready To Spread.

17. Pinch Of Salt
18. Oil For Frying","1. Make The Seitan Following The Instruction : Below:
2. There Are Loads Of Recipes For Seitan And I Am Working My Way Through Them, Learning As I Go. For This Recipe I Tried One By Isa Chandra (Chicken Stylee Seitan, Available On Theppk.Com) And Because It Was A Big Batch I Tried A Couple Of Different Ways Of Cooking It. I Think Either Way Would Work And I Would Definitely Try The Boiled  For This Recipe Next Time.
3. I Followed The Recipe By Isa Chandra Up To The Point Of Cooking. At That Point, I Separated The Seitan Dough In To Two Batches. With One, I Followed The Recipe, Gentry Cooking The Seitan In Stock. This Was The Most Successful Of My Attempts So Far. It Is Really, Really Important Not To Let It Boil. I Got All Tech About It And Dragged Out The Jam Thermometer. I Kept It Between 94 And 98 Degrees.
4. Anyway, For This Particular Version, I Took The Other Half Of The Seitan And Formed It In To Small Nuggets. Keep Them On The Small Side Because They Will Expand On Cooking. I Put Them On An Oiled Baking Tray And Covered Them With Tin Foil And Baked For 20 – 30 Mins At 180Oc. Keep An Eye On Them, They Are Only Small So It Won’T Take Much To Burn Them. My Thinking With This Was That It Keep Them Dry And Therefore Make The Coating Stick Better.
5. If You Have The Time, The Stock  Would Work Too But You Would Want To Leave Them To Drain For Quite A While And Get As Much Stock Out Of Them As You Can Before Trying To Do The Coating.
6. If You Don’T Fancy Making Your Own Seitan Or You Have Your Own Preferred Product Or Recipe, You Could Just Use That. If You Are Still Searching For That Perfect Recipe, Give Isa’S Recipe A Go.
7. You Will Need 2 Bowls And A Drying Rack To Complete All Of The Coating Process And To Also Drain Off The Seitan Once Cooked.
8. Start Off By Making The Vegan Butter Milk. Combine The Ingredients And Then Let Sit For 5 To 10 Mins Whilst You Get All The Ingredients For The Flour Together And Mix Them Well In A Bowl. By The Time You Have Got Them All Sorted, Your Buttermilk Should Be Good To Go.
9. In Your Second Bowl, Mix The Buttermilk With The Hot Sauce And Salt. You Are Now Ready To Being The Coating Process.
10. Add The Seitan To The Buttermilk And Let Soak For 10 Mins. One Soaked, Add The Pieces A Few At A Time To The Flour And Coat Well Before Putting On The Drying Rack And Leaving For Another 5 To 10 Mins. You Can Use This Time To Get Your Oil Heated Up. You Want It At 180Oc. Be Careful, Don’T Burn Your House Down Or Anything.
11. Once The Seitan Pieces Have Sat In The Coating For 10 Mins, We Repeat The Coating Process. This Helps More Of The Flour Stick And Also Creates All Sort Of Lumps, Bumps And Crevices Which Are Going To Make This Really Good. Straight In To The Buttermilk, Straight In To The Flour And Then In To The 180Oc Oil.
12. The Most Important Tip I Found Was To Leave The Pieces Along For At Least 3 Minutes Otherwise You Risk Knocking The Coating Off. Overall Mine Took About 8 Mins To Get Nice And Golden. My Pan Was Not Big Enough To Cook The Whole Lot And Yours Probably Won’T Be Either So I Did A Couple Of Batches And Kept The First Batch Warm In A Low Oven. I Chucked The First Batch In The Oil Again For A Minute At The End, Just Because.",250,23,17,10,Main Course,Dinner,1,https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_5929-1200x1200.jpg,vegan-fried-chicken

Alternatively You Can Use Medjool Dates (Don’T Forgot To Remove The Stones!) Which Are Much Softer And Also Larger, So Halve The Number Required. It’S Also Really Nice To Use A Mix Of Tomatoes If You Can – Yellow, Red, Plum, Cherry, Heirloom Etc. It Just Looks So Beautiful In The Bowl, But If You Can Only Get Standard Tomatoes Then I Recommend Going For A Mix Of Large And Cherry, All On The Vine For Added Flavour.
2. Place Half Of The Tomatoes (Choose The Prettier Ones To Chop Up Later) Into A Blender With The Juice Of The Orange And Lemon, Clove Of Garlic, Cider Vinegar, Dates, Cumin, Chilli And Oil.

9. 2 Tablespoons Olive Oil
10. 1 Heaped Teaspoon Sea Salt
11. 2 Tablespoons Gram Flour Chickpea Flour
12. Extra Gram Flour For Rolling With","1. Scrub And Chop The Sweet Potato And Boil Until Soft With Skin Still Included (Approximately 10 Minutes). Then Drain And Place In A Mixing Bowl.
2. Crush Garlic And Chop Along With Coriander Leaves (As Small As You Can) With A Sharp Knife.
3. Add All Ingredients Into Blender Or Food Processor (Except The Gram Flour). I Find This Actually Works Best With A Hand (Immersion) Blender. With A Hand Blender, You Can Apply Downward Pressure And Get In There Nicely… If You Use A Jug Blender Or Food Processor It Will Work Fine If You Keep Scraping Down The Sides And Loosen The Mixture. Alternatively You Could Go For The Real Rustic Effect And Use A Strong Potato Masher To Do The Job Instead. Blend Until Most Of The Mixture Is Broken Down. It Doesn’T Need To Be Totally Smooth; It Can Be Quite Rustic.
4. Once Blended Add The Gram Flour And Continue To Mix In With A Spoon. If You Leave It On The Side For A While (Half And Hour Or Half A Day) Then It Will Firm Up A Little Making It Slightly Easier To Roll. I Sometimes Let It Stand If I Have Time, But That’S Not Essential.
5. Chickpea Moisture Varies From Batch To Batch. The Mixture Should Be Soft And Pliable, Easy To Roll Into A Ball In Your Hands. Take A Heaped Teaspoon Worth Of Mixture And Roll A Small Ball (This Should Be Smaller Than A Golf Ball). The Delightful Yellowness Glow Of The Turmeric Will Rub Off A Bit On Your Hands. If You’D Rather Now Yellow-Out Your Hands Then Use Extra Gram Flour To Roll With. If Your Mixture Is Too Soft To Roll Well, Then Add A Little Extra Gram Flour Or Use Gram Flour To Roll In.
6. Place On A Lightly Oiled Baking Tray And Bake In Preheated Oven At Gas Mark 6 Or 7 (200˚C To 220˚C/ 400˚F To 425˚F) For Approximately 30 Minutes Or Until Tanned.

9. 1 Tbsp Olive Oil
10. Tsp Fine Sea Salt Or Kosher Salt Or More To Taste
11. Tsp Coarse Ground Black Pepper
12. Tsp Ground Cumin
13. Ripe But Firm Avocado Diced","1. Canned Green Jackfruit Bears A Resemblance To Flaked Crabmeat When Cooked. It Can Be Found In Indian And Asian Markets Or Purchased Through The Internet. Look For The Label “Green Jackfruit” Or “Young Green Jackfruit” And Be Sure That It’S Packed In Water Or Brine And Not Syrup. Cans Of Ripe Jackfruit Packed In Syrup May Be Stocked Nearby, But Don’T Be Tempted To Substitute As The Ripe Fruit Will Be Too Sweet For This Application.
2. *Chef’S Note: Traditional Ceviche Made With Fresh Seafood Has A Fresh, Clean Flavor And Should Not Be Fishy. If You Wish To Add A Subtle Ocean Flavor To This Plant-Based Version Add A Little Bit Of Dried Kelp Flakes Or Flaked, Toasted Nori.
3. Drain The Jackfruit And Rinse. If The Jackfruit Was Canned In Brine, Rinse Thoroughly. Add The Chunks Of Jackfruit To 1 Quart Salted Boiling Water. Reduce The Heat To A Slow Boil And Cook For 15 Minutes. Drain In A Colander And Let Cool. When Cool Enough To Handle, Remove The Tough Core From Each Chunk Of Jackfruit With A Sharp Knife And Discard. Break The Chunks Apart With Your Fingers And Remove The Soft Seeds And Seed Membranes And Discard. The Remaining Flaky Pulp Is The Only Portion You Will Want To Use In The Dish, So Sort Through The Chunks Carefully (There Will Be A Significant Amount Of Unusable Material). Wrap The Pulp In A Lint-Free Kitchen Towel And Squeeze To Remove Excess Water. Coarsely Chop The Pulp And Place In A Mixing Bowl.
4. Add The Remaining Ingredients Except For The Avocado And Toss Well To Combine. Refrigerate For Several Hours To Marinate The Ingredients And Blend The Flavors. Add The Diced Avocado Just Before Serving And Toss Well. The Avocado Can Also Be Placed Into A Ring Mold And The Ceviche Layered On Top For A Lovely Presentation. Season The Ceviche With Additional Salt As Desired And To Taste. Serve With Crunchy Tortilla Chips.
5. Tip: Strips Of Flour Or Corn Tortilla That Have Been Flash-Fried In Cooking Oil Make An Interesting And Crunchy Garnish.

15. 6 Tsp Olive Oil
16. 1 Tsp Nutritional Yeast
17. Tsp Salt","1. Finely Chop The Onions. Using A Heavy Based, Lidded Pan Heat 2 Tbsp Of Olive Oil And Add The Onions Giving Them A Quick Stir So They Get Coated In The Oil. Pop The Lid On The Pan And, Keeping The Heat Low, Sweat The Onion For Around 10 Mins, Stirring Occasionally, Until Translucent. While The Onion Is Cooking You Can Prepare The Courgettes. Give Them A Wash, And Cut Away Any Damaged Skin. Slice Each Courgette In Half Lengthways And Slice Into ¼ Inch Pieces. When The Onions Are Cooked, Add The Courgettes, Bay Leaf, Herbs De Provence And Mustard Powder, Give Them A Good Stir, And Balance The Lid Back On The Pan So It Is Slightly Ajar. The Cooking Time Here Will Vary A Little Depending On The Size Of The Courgettes But This Should Be Around 20-25 Minutes With The Courgettes Taking On A Translucent Appearance When They Are Cooked.
2. While The Courgettes Are Cooking, Make The Pesto. Using A Food Processor Or A Pestle And Mortar Blend Together The Pine Nuts, Garlic, Mint And 4 Tsp Of The Olive Oil. Once A Coarse Paste Is Formed Add The Salt And The Nutritional Yeast. Give Another Quick Blend So The New Ingredients Are Integrated But The Texture Of The Pesto Remains Coarse.
3. Once The Courgettes Are Cooked, Add The Vegetable Stock And Grate In The Nutmeg. Keeping The Pan On A Low Heat Stir Well For A Minute Or Two Before Transferring The Contents To The Blender (Or Leave In The Pan If Using A Hand Blender). Puree The Soup Adding Some Hot Water If The Soup Is Too Thick, And Return To The Pan.
4. Zest The Lemon. Cover The Zest As It Dries Out Incredibly Quickly And Set Aside Until Serving. Disposing Of Any Pips, Squeeze The Juice Into The Hot Soup. Give A Quick Stir And Check The Seasoning.

2. Place A Saucepan On A Low-Medium Heat And Add The Oats, Spices And Milk.
3. Wash The Apple And Grate It Before Adding It To The Saucepan Straight Away Before It Browns. Stir The Porridge Well Whilst It Cooks To Ensure You Get A Nice Creamy Porridge.
4. Whilst The Porridge Cooks, Heat A Frying Pan On A High Heat And Add The Hazelnuts. Shake Occasionally To Prevent Burning Until The Skins Start To Peel Away. Transfer Onto Some Kitchen Towel And Leave To Cool Slightly Before Rubbing In The Towel To Remove The Skins. Meanwhile Toast The Pumpkin Seeds In The Frying Pan, Shaking The Pan Until They Start To Pop Then Transfer Into A Bowl To Cool.
5. When The Porridge Starts To Thicken You May Need To Add Some Water, Up To 50Ml To Get Your Preferred Consistency. (I Always Find How Much Liquid You Require Can Vary Quite Dramatically Depending On What Oats You Use). After 15-20 Minutes You Should Have Perfect Creamy Porridge Ready To Serve.

2. 50G 1 Oz Raw Cocoa Butter
3. 50G 1 Oz Raw Cocoa Powder
4. 3 Tablespoons Raw Coconut Sugar
5. 1 Teaspoon Vanilla Extract
6. Filling Ingredients
7. 70G 2Oz Fresh Blueberries
8. 40G 1Oz Coconut Butter
9. 1 Medjool Date Pitted","1. You Will Need: A Heart-Shaped Chocolate Mould With 12 Hearts. You Can Use Any Chocolate Mould Shape If You’D Prefer A Different Shape.
2. You Can Also Watch A Video Demonstration Of Chocolate Making
3. Step One:
4. ‘Shave’ The Solid Cocoa Butter With A Sharp Knife Or Grater. Shaving Is Just Really Thin Slicing That Makes The Cocoa Butter Crumble. The Finer You Can Get It, The Easier It Will Be To Melt. You Can Leave It In Big Chunks If You Like, But Be Prepared To Wait A While For It To Melt.
5. Step Two:
6. Melt The Cocoa Butter. You Can Do This By Leaving It In A Warm Place In A Heat Proof Glass Bowl By A Fire Or Directly Above A Hot Radiator. It Melts At 34˚C. The Idea Is To Melt It, Rather Than Cook It, Maintaining Its ‘Un-Cookedness’. If You Don’T Have A Gentle Heat Source Then Use A Hob Or Stove.
7. Put The Cocoa Butter In A Small, Oven Proof, Glass Bowl And Then Put That Bowl In A Pan Containing An Inch Or So Of Really Hot Water. Keep The Hob/Stove Burning On A Low Heat. The Heat Will Then Transfer Through The Bowl, Enough To Melt The Cocoa Butter. Give It Frequent Stirs To Assist The Melting Process. Don’T Keep It On The Heat Any Longer Than It Takes To Melt It.
8. The Best Time To Use It Is When It Has Just Melted. If It Is Too Hot, Then It Takes Longer To Cool Down And The Coconut Sugar Will Sink To The Bottom Of The Chocolate When Added.
9. Step Three:
10. Add The Coconut Sugar To The Melting Cocoa Butter During Step Two. The Melting Cocoa Butter Will Help To Soften And Dissolve The Sugar.
11. Step Four:
12. When The Cocoa Butter Has Finally Melted, Mix In The Cocoa Powder And Any Other Remaining Ingredients.
13. Here’S The Fun Part!
14. Making Chocolate Hearts:
15. Place 1 Teaspoon Of Your Melted Chocolate Mixture Into Each Heart-Shaped Well. When You’Ve Put Some In Every Heart, Pop Them Into The Freezer Whilst You Prepare And Blend The Filling Ingredients.
16. Prepare The Filling:
17. Blend All The Filling Ingredients Together Thoroughly And Leave On The Side Whilst You Make The Chocolate.
18. Making Chocolate Hearts Continued:
19. Take Your Hearts Out Of The Freezer (After About 10 Minutes Worth Of Chilling) And Place The Blueberry Filling Into Each One. This Is Slightly Fiddly! Use A Teaspoon And A Knife To Help The Process…
20. Take About ½ A Teaspoon Of Filling And Gently Dollop It On Top Of The Freshly Chilled Chocolate Hearts. Aim Right For The Middle Of The Heart. You’Ll Find That Some Always Hits The Edges… Simply Tease It Back With Your Knife To Create A Thin Gap At The Edges (You’Ll See Why Next).
21. Take The Rest Of Your Melted Chocolate (You Should Have Some Left – If Not – Make Some More) And Pour 2 Or 3 Teaspoons Over Each Dollop. Place Your Tray Of Hearts Straight Into The Freezer To Help Your Chocolates Set. This Should Be Ready In About 15 Minutes. You Can Also Set Them By Leaving In The Fridge Or Any Cool Place (But Allow Extra Time For Setting).

Roast Garlic For Up To 10 Minutes And The Pepper For About 15-20 Minutes (Or Until The Pepper Is Easy To Pierce).

2. If Your Peppers Don’T Sit Upright In The Saucepan Because There Is Space Around Them, Then Squeeze An Onion Or A Potato In Next To Them To Make Them Sit Tight.
3. Add Some Olive Oil To The Pan Of Boiling Water The Peppers Cook In. This Will Add A Bit Of Flavour And Soften Them Up Nicely.
4. If You’D Prefer To Use White Rice, Just Cut Out The First Stage. Add Your Rice Into The Onion Mixture Without Pre-Cooking It.
5. Cook The Brown Rice For Half Of The Time It Suggests On The Packet.
6. While The Rice Is Cooking You Can Prep The Peppers And Filling – Wash The Peppers And Cut The Tops Off, Making Sure The Green Stalk Is Still Attached So You Can Use The Top Of The Pepper For A Lid. De-Seed And Place All Six In A Saucepan So They Stand Upright. Set Aside.
7. Dice The Onion And Gently Fry In A Medium Sized Frying Pan With A Little Olive Oil. Dice The Courgette Into Small Pieces And Add To The Pan Along With The Crushed Garlic. Add The Currants And Spices.
8. By This Time Your Rice Should Be Ready. Drain It And Add It To The Pan. Stir To Combine Everything, Turn Up The Heat And Add Your Stock. Once It Starts Bubbling Turn Down To A Low Heat And Let Simmer Until The Liquid Has Evaporated And The Rice Has Fully Cooked. Add More Liquid If Needed. Once Cooked, Taste And Season.
9. Spoon The Rice Into The Peppers, Filling Them To The Top, Then Place The Top Of The Pepper Back On. Repeat, So All Six Peppers Are Filled.
10. Carefully Pour Some Boiling Water Into The Saucepan, Which The Peppers Are Sitting In, Making Sure Not To Pour It Over The Peppers. The Water Should Come Up To About Half The Height Of The Peppers. Put A Lid On, Turn The Hob Onto A Medium Heat And Let Them Simmer For 30 -45 Minutes Until The Peppers Have Softened.

20. 3 Tablespoons Organic Ketchup

Bring To A Boil, Reduce Heat, Cover And Simmer For About 35 – 40 Minutes, Stirring Occasionally. It’S Ok If They Get Mushy, We Are Going To Roughly Puree 3/4 Of The Mixture When Cooled. Once Done, Remove Lid And Set Aside To Cool (There Should Only Be A Little Bit Of Water So Do Not Drain), Lentils Will Thicken A Bit Upon Standing, About 15 Minutes Is Good.
2. Preheat Oven To 350 Degrees.
3. Make Flax Egg: In Small Bowl Combine Flaxseed Meal And 1/3 Cup Water, Set Aside For At Least 10 Minutes, Preferably In The Refrigerator. This Will Act As A Binder And Will Thicken Nicely Upon Sitting.

Place Mixture Into A Loaf Pan Lined With Parchment Paper, Leaving It Overlapping For Easy Removal Later. Press Down Firmly Filling In Along The Edges Too.
7. Glaze: Prepare Your Glaze By Combining All Ingredients In A Small Bowl, Mix Until Incorporated. I Recommend Making Each Tablespoon Heaping So You Have Plenty Of This Great Sauce On Top (If Using Tomato Paste And Mixture Is Too Thick, Add A Teaspoon Of Water, Or A Little Extra Vinegar & Syrup). Spread Evenly Over Top The Loaf.

4. Store: Leftovers Can Be Stored In The Refrigerator For 5 – 6, Kept In Airtight Container. To Store Longer, Store In The Freezer With Freezer Safe Containers For 2 – 3 Months.
5. Notes:
6. Mix The Beans Up However You Like Using All Of One Type Or Your Favorite Combination. If You Would Rather Use Only 2 Cans Of Beans, That’S Great Too! I Like Adding More Ingredients As It Makes The Chili Go Further. If Using Your Own Cooked Beans You’Ll Need About 4 1/2 Cups.
7. Feel Free To Use 2 Packages Tempeh Instead Of Just 1. At Times I Like The Extra Dose Of Protein The Tempeh Adds And Will Double The Amount Making For An Extra Hearty Chili. It’S Just So Good!
8. For Those Who Do Not Care For The Taste Of Tempeh, I Recommend Making This A Day Ahead So The Flavors Really Meld Into The Tempeh Masking Most Of Its Natural Flavor. Or Try Using The Three Grain Tempeh As Its Flavor Is Not As Strong.
9. If You Find If You Added Too Much Heat From The Chipotle, Try Adding A Teaspoon Or So Of Cocoa/Cacao Powder Or Organic Sugar.

2. The Rice: The Cilantro Lime Rice Takes About 25 – 30 From Start To Finish So It’S A Good Idea To Get That Started After The Beans, Unless Using Canned Beans Than You Can Start With The Rice.

12. 12 Cup Coconut Oil At Room Temperature Or Hard Cubed Vegan Butter Is Ok Too","1. Preheat Oven To 425 Degrees F.
2. Vegan Buttermilk: Measure The Milk And The Juice Of 1 Lemon Or Apple Cider Vinegar, Let Rest For 5 – 10 Minutes To Curdle.
3. Strawberries: Place The Strawberries In A Medium Bowl With 2 Teaspoons Pure Cane Sugar And Combine. Set Aside For At Least 20 Minutes. The Longer They Rest, The Juicer (More Macerated) They Will Become.
4. Shortcakes:
5. Dry Ingredients: In A Large Mixing Bowl, Combine The Flour, Sugar, Baking Powder And Salt.
6. Cut The Oil (Or Butter): Add The Coconut Oil And Cut The Oil Into The Flour Using A Fork Or Pastry Blender. When Done Flour Should Be Lumpy With Little Balls Of Flour.
7. Combine Dry And Wet: Pour The Vegan Buttermilk Into The Flour Mixture And Mix To Combine. Don’T Overmix The Dough, Mix Just Until Combined.
8. Flatten Dough: Once Dough Is Formed, Place It On A Lightly Floured Flat Surface. Using Your Hands, Flatten And Mold The Dough Into A Circle Shape About 1/2 Inch Thick (A Rolling Pin Will Work Too).
9. Cut Dough: Cut Circles Using A 3 Inch Cookie Cutter (A Glass Is Ok Too). Dip The Cutter In Flour Before Each Cut To Keep It From Sticking. Leftover Dough Can Be Reshaped And Cut. You Should Get 12 Shortcakes.
10. Prep For Baking: Place The Shortcakes On An Ungreased Baking Sheet, Or Lined With A Silpat Or Parchement Paper. Make Sure The Sides Are Touching Each Other, This Will Make Them Cling To One Another, Rising Bigger And Taller.
11. Garnish Biscuits: Brush The Tops With A Little Almond Milk And Sprinkle With Pure Cane Sugar Or Turbinado. The Sugar Will Give The Shortcake Tops A Nice Crunchy Texture.
12. Bake: Place Shortcakes In The Oven And Bake For 15 Minutes. Let Cool A Few Minutes Before Assembling Your Strawberry Shortcakes.
13. Assemble Shortcakes: To Serve, Slice Shortcakes In Half, Top With Strawberries And Generous Dollop Of Vegan Whipped Cream.
14. Makes 12 Strawberry Shortcakes.
15. Store Leftover Biscuits, Covered, On The Counter For 4 Days. Or Keep Them Stored In The Refrigerator For Up To 7 – 10 Days. You Can Also Freeze Them For Up To 2 Months (Let Thaw On The Counter Or In The Fridge). Warm Them Back Up In A Toaster Oven.
16. Notes:
17. Types Of Flours: My Favorite Is Unbleached All-Purpose When Making Shortcakes. It Yields The Most Tender And Fluffiest Biscuits. You Could Also Try Half All-Purpose And Half Whole Grain, Just Don’T Skimp On The Oil Or Butter.
18. Tips For Cutting Biscuits:
19. To Keep The Dough From Sticking To The Cutter, Keep A Small Bowl Or Plate Of Flour Nearby And Dip The Cutter Into The Flour, Shaking Any Loose Flour Away, Before Making Cuts.
20. Don’T Twist The Cutter When Making Cuts, It Creates A Seal And The Biscuits Won’T Rise As Well.

Place Sheet On The Middle Rack And Cook For About 25 Minutes Stirring Every 10 Minutes, Vegetables Are Done When Just Fork Tender.
3. Noodles: Cook Your Soba Noodles According To The Package Directions. Be Sure To Use A Large Pot Filled Just Under Half Way When Cooking Soba Noodles. Once The Noodles Have Come To A Boil, The Water Tends To Foam Up Quickly And Overflow (Ugg, I’Ve Learned From Experience). Pay Attention And Reduce The Heat As Needed To Prevent The Water From Boiling Over While Keeping The Water At A Gentle Rolling Boil. Most Importantly, When Done Rinse The Noodles Right Away Under Cool Running Water To Keep Them From Cooking (Or Else You’Ll Have Mushy Noodles On Your Hands).
4. Miso Broth: Heat Your Water In A Small Pan Until Nicely Warmed, But Not Boiling, (Use The Pot The Noodles Were Cooked In To Save A Dish). Remove From Heat, Add Miso And Mix Until Miso Is Dissolved. This Keeps The Miso From Overheating And Killing The Beneficial Probiotics. You Can Opt To Keep It On The Burner On Low To Keep Warm Until Veggies Are Done.
5. Assemble Soup: Add Noodles And Vegetables To Your Serving Bowl, Top With Broth And Add A Few Of The Garnishes. Some Other Optional Garnishes Would Be A Dash Or Two Of Sriracha Or Red Pepper Flakes.

It Is Recommended To Rinse Rice Before Cooking To Remove Any Loose Starches That May Make Your Cooked Rice To Become Gummy. I Almost Never Do This, But If You Find Your Rice Does Become Gummy, You May Need To Make A Habit Of It. If Using Canilla Rice, Which Calls For Skipping This Step To Keep All The Nutrients, I’Ve Never Had A Problem With Gumminess Using This Rice.

Pour The Water Overtop And Cook According To Manufacturer’S Manual. Once The Rice Is Finished, Remove Bay Leaf. Let Cool A Few Minutes, Add The Cilantro And Lime Juice, Fluff With A Fork. Taste For Salt And Add More Lime Or Cilantro To Taste.
4. Instant Pot: Add The Rice, Water And Salt To The Bowl Of Your Instant Pot. Attach The Lid And Turn To Lock The Lid. Set The Steam Valve To Seal. Cook White Rice For 4-8 Minutes. If Using Other Rice, See This Instant Pot Cooking Chart. Allow The Pressure To Release Naturally For 10 Minutes And Then Carefully Release Any Remaining Pressure.
5. Store: Leftover Rice Can Be Stored In The Refrigerator For Up To 4 – 5 Days, Kept In An Airtight Container. If Planning On Storing Leftovers, Be Sure To Cool It Quickly And Store It Within 2 Hours To Avoid Bacteria Growth. To Keep Longer, Store In The Freezer Using Freezer Safe Containers Or Baggies For Up To 2 Months.
6. To Reheat: Add A Splash Of Water Over The Top To Loosen The Clumps Of Dried Grains. Reheat The Rice In A Pot Over Medium-Low Heat On The Stovetop, Stirring Occasionally Until Heated Through. Or Heat In The Microwave, Covered, Using 30 Second Intervals, Stirring After Each Interval, Until Rice Is Warmed Through.",230,40,20,15,Main Course,Dinner,0,https://simple-veganista.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cilantro-lime-rice-recipe-9.jpg,cilantro-lime-rice

I Suggest Adding In 1 Tablespoon Of Lemon Juice Or Water At A Time. If You Find Your Cream Is A Bit Too Runny, Add In A Few Cashews And Blend. You Can Serve At Room Temp Or Refrigerate A Bit Before Serving. The Cream Can Be Made A Day Or Two Ahead Of Time.
2. Simple Syrup: Combine Either The Dates, Water, And Vanilla Or Maple Syrup And Vanilla Into A Small Blender (I Used The Magic Bullet) And Blend Until Smooth. Feel Free To Add A Tad Bit More Water As Needed To Thin If Using Dates. You Can Serve At Room Temp Or Refrigerate A Bit Before Serving. The Simple Syrup Can Be Made A Day Or Two In Advance.
3. Plums: Slice Your Plums Thinly Just Before Serving. I Have Given A More Detailed Way Of Slicing Above.

7. 1 12 Cups Lukewarm Water
8. 1 Packet Active Dry Yeast About 2 14 Teaspoons
9. 2 Teaspoons Himalayan Salt

2. Mix: In A Very Large Mixing Bowl Combine The Water, Yeast And Salt. If Adding Herbs, Now Is A Good Time, Use A Teaspoon Or So Of Your Favorite Herbs Or Double If Using Fresh. Add Flour All At Once And Stir With A Wooden Spoon. Takes Only A Minute, If That. No Need To Knead, Just Mix. You Just Want Everything Mixed Well, No Streaks Of Flour Left, And You’Re Done.
3. Rise: Cover Container Loosely (I Used A Towel To Cover). Let It Rise In A Warm Area With No Draft, May Take Anywhere From 2 To 4 Hours Depending On Temperatures (Ideal Temp Is 80 – 90).
4. Separate: Once Done, If Making The Master Recipe, Pull Away 1/4 Of The Dough And Refrigerate The Rest To Bake Later. Store Unused Dough Covered Tightly With Plastic Wrap In The Refrigerator For Up To 2 Weeks.
5. Shape:Lightly Dust Your Hands And Flat Surface With Flour, Or Cornmeal, So It Won’T Stick. Take Your Dough And Place It On The Floured Flat Surface, Gently Pull The Sides Of The Dough Toward The Bottom, Rotating The Dough Until You Get A Roundish Shape With A Smooth Surface. Also, Don’T Worry If The Bottom Is A Little Bunched, It Will Flatten Out Upon The Second Rising.
6. Rest:Place Your Dough Ball Onto A Flat Surface Lined With Parchment Paper (If Not Using Parchment Paper, Place On Flat Surface Dusted With Cornmeal Or Flour), And Let It Rest For At Least 30 Minutes. No Need To Cover It. If The Dough Has Been Refrigerated, It Helps To Let It Rest A Little More, Until It’S No Longer Chilled.
7. Bake The Dough:
8. Preheat The Oven To 450 Degrees F. Placing A Cast Iron Skillet, Pizza Stone, Roasting Pan Or Shallow Fry Pan In The Oven To Get It Nice And Hot (A Baking Sheet Will Be Fine Too). Let The Oven Preheat For 30 Minutes.
9. Prep Oven And Dough: When Ready To Bake, Place A Rimmed Cookie Sheet Or Small Pot With At Least 1 Cup Of Water On The Bottom Rack To Steam – This Will Help The Crust Get Nice And Crispy, But It’S Fine If You Skip It. Line Your Baking Vessel With Parchment Paper Or Lightly Flour With Cornmeal. Dust A Little Flour On Top Of Your Loaf, Using A Knife Slash The Top, About 1/4 Inch Deep, In A Cross, Tick Tac Toe Or Scallop Pattern (This Helps The Bread Expand When Baking While Also Giving It A Rustic Look).
10. Bake: Place Prepped Dough In Center Of Baking Vessel And Place In The Oven, Center Rack, For 30 – 40 Minutes, Until You Get A Nice Brown Crust.

https://simple-veganista.com/how-to-roast-peppers/,HOW TO ROAST & STORE RED PEPPERS (OR ANY PEPPER REALLY!),"1. 1  8 Peppers Any Color
2. If Making A Large Batch And Storing In The Freezer
3. Parchment Paper
4. Air Tight Containers That Are Freezer Safe
5. For Storing In Jars
6. Vinegar Plain Balsamic Whitered Wine Or Apple Cider
7. Mineral Salt
8. Olive Oil
9. Clean Pint Sized Mason Jars","1. Prepping Peppers:
2. There Are Two Ways To Prepare Your Peppers For Roasting.
3. The First Is To Simply Roast The Whole Pepper, Seeds, Stem And All. (This Will Work With All Roasting S.)
4. The Second Is To Slice The Peppers In Half Lengthwise, Remove The Stem And Seeds, And Place On The Baking Sheet Cut Side Down. (Use This  For The Oven  And/Or When Using A Baking Sheet. These Peppers Require No Flipping, Only Rotating Of The Baking Sheet. This Is My Favorite Way Of Roasting Peppers.)
5. Roasting S:
6. Oven: Preheat Oven To 475 Degrees F. Line A Baking Sheet With Parchment Or A Silpat.
7. Place Peppers On Baking Sheet. Bake 4 – 5 Inches From The Flame. If Using An Electric Oven Or There Is No Flame, Place Baking Sheet On The Middle Rack. Roast Peppers For 40 Minutes, Turning At Least Once During Cooking Using Sturdy Tongs (If Peppers Are Sliced In Half No Need To Turn, Just Rotate The Baking Sheet 180 Degrees). They Are Ready When Charred/Blackened And Blistered. Whole Peppers Will Still Be Full Of Air And Puffy Once Removed From The Oven. As The Peppers Cool They Will Deflate And Become Wrinkly Looking.
8. Broiler: I Used To Have An Oven Where The Broiler Was Underneath The Oven, Now Mine Is In The Oven. Either Way, Turn Broiler To Medium – High (Or 500 Degrees If Yours Is By Numbers) And Char Peppers Turning Every So Often Until Browned And Blackened. If You’Ve Prepped Your Peppers By Slicing In Half, No Need Turn The Peppers, Simply Adjust The Baking Sheet Turning It To Get All The Peppers Charred. This May Take Anywhere From 15 – 25 Minutes.
9. Open Grill: Place Whole Peppers On Their Sides Over An Open Flame On The Grill, Turning Every Now And Then Until Nicely Charred All Over. Depending On How Big Your Grill Is Will Determine How Many You Can Do At One Time.
10. Stove Top: If Roasting Just 1 Or 2 Peppers, You Can Roast It Over The Gas Burner Of Your Stove (I Suppose You Could Do 4 Peppers Utilizing Each Burner). Place Pepper On Its Side And Adjust The Flame So It ‘Licks’ The Peppers. Keep An Eye On It And Turn It As Needed To Blacken And Char, About 15 – 20. This Tends To Be A More Time Consuming  Since You Have To Be So Watchful.
11. Steaming & Peeling:
12. While Peppers Are Hot From The Oven, Carefully Place Them In A Bowl And Cover With A Plate, Or Use A Pot With Lid. The Goal Is To Steam The Peppers Making The Skin Peel Easily. Let The Peppers Steam For About 30 Minutes. Once Peppers Are Cool, Remove The Skins, Stems And Seeds. I Find It Easiest To Peel The Pepper From The Bottom To The Top. A Few Seeds Left Are Fine. Do Not Run Peppers Under Water To Clean, You’Ll Lose Most Of The Roasted Flavor That You Worked So Hard Get. Keep As Much Of The Pepper Juices As You Can If Storing Leftovers.
13. From Here You Can Use Right Away To Make Hummus, Romesco, Soups, Layer On Sandwiches And Toss In Salads, Etc.
14. Storing:
15. Rerfrigerator:Great For Short Term Storage.
16. Keep Leftovers In An Airtight Container In The Refrigerator For Up To A 5 – 6 Days.
17. If You Coat Them With A Little Oil They Will For A Couple Of Weeks. You Can Even Add Some Of The Pepper Juices To The Container.
18. To Always Be Safe, At The First Sign Of Mold Or Spoilage, Throw Away Immediately.
19. If Storing For Longer, You Have A Couple Simple Options:
20. Freezing:This Is My Favorite  Of Long Term Storing, As It Is Not Blended With Any Other Flavors, It’S Super Easy To Do, And They Thaw Out Amazingly Well.
21. Freeze Your Peppers In A Tightly Sealed Container. They Thaw Out Pretty Fast Once Removed From The Freezer Making This A Nice Way Of Preserving Your Precious Peppers.
22. This  Of Storing Is A Neutral Way Of Keeping The Full Roasted Flavor Intact As They Won’T Be Tainted With Any Other Flavors.
23. I Would Suggest Cutting And Placing A Small Piece Of Parchment Paper Between The Peppers For Easy Removal.
24. Will Last Up To 2 Months.
25. Vinegar :This Is  Will Leave Your Peppers With A Little Bit Of Tang From The Vinegar, In Some Cases It May Overpower Them, But It’S A Great Way To Store Them. Use These Peppers For Sauces, Dips, And Soups.
26. Place Peppers In A Jar With A Little Salt, Vinegar And Pepper Juices.
27. To Do This You’Ll Want To Sprinkle Your Peppers With A Generous Pinch Of Mineral Salt And Mix Well.
28. Place 1/2 Inch Of Vinegar At The Bottom Of Your Pint Sized Mason Jar, Add Peppers Leaving About 1 1/2 Inches Headspace.
29. Using The Handle Of A Spoon Or Fork, Poke Along The Inside Edges Of The Jar To Release Air Bubbles (This Is Important), Pour Reserved Pepper Juices Over Top So Peppers Are Completely Covered, Leaving 3/4 Inch Room.
30. Add About 1/8 Inch Of Olive Oil Over Top To Keep Air Out, Leaving 1/2 Inch Headspace.
31. Seal And Place Towards The Back Of The Refrigerator. Will Be Good For Up To 2 Months, Maybe Even A Little Longer.

2. Unpeeled: Wash The Apples Well, Quarter And Core The Apples, Cut The Quarters In Half.
3. Peeled: Peel The Apples, Quarter, Core And Cut The Quarters In Half.
4. Instant Pot:
5. Place Apples In The Bottom Of The Instant Pot, Add The Lemon Juice, Water And Optional Cinnamon.
6. Attach Lid, And Make Sure Vent Is In The Sealed Position. Push The Pressure Cooker Button, And Manually Set The Time For 6 Minutes.

8. Mash Or Puree: If Cooking With The Skins On, Use An Immersion Blender Right In The Pot To Puree The Mixture, Or Transfer To A Blender Or Food Processor To Puree Until Desired Consistency. When Cooking Without The Skins You Can Simply Mash With A Potato Masher Or Back Of A Fork Or Slotted Spoon.

15. Notes:
16. For Ultra Smooth Applesauce, Use A Blender To Puree.
17. If You Prefer More Sweetness, Add A Tad Of Sugar 1 – 2 Teaspoons At A Time Until Desired Sweetness.
18. If You Didn’T Add Cinnamon While Cooking, Feel Free To Add Some After Cooking.
19. Picking Apples:
20. When Picking Your Apples Stick With Your Favorites To Start, Using All Of One Type Or A Combination Of 2 – 3 Types Of Apples. Organic Is Best, Especially If Cooking With The Skins On!
21. I’Ve Used All Fuji Apples Which Were Delicious And On The Sweeter Side. So If You Prefer Your Applesauce To Be Very Sweet Use Only Fuji.
22. As For Combinations, My Favorites Are A Mix Of Fuji And Granny Smith Apples Or A Mix Of Honey Crisp, Granny Smith And Fuji. These Combos Balance Each Other Out Well, Having Just The Right Amount Of Natural Sweetness And Tartness.
23. To Peel Or Not To Peel Your Apples?
24. Peeling: It Takes A Bit Longer To Prep But The End Result Is A Little Easier Since You’Ll Simply Need To Mash The Apples With A Potato Masher, Back Of A Fork Or Back Of A Slotted Spoon.
25. No Peel:The Prep Time Moves Along Quicker, But The End Time May Take A Little Longer With The Need To Use An Immersion Blender, Or Transferring The Cooked Apples To A Blender Or Food Processor, To Get A Smooth Consistency.

9. 3  4 Scallions Green Onions Sliced 1 Inch","1. Preparing Cabbage: Quarter Cabbage And Chop Laterally Into About 2 Inch Pieces. Place Cabbage In An Extra Large Bowl Or Pot. Combine Salt With 2 Cups Of Lukewarm Water, Stir To Dissolve Salt. Pour Salt Water Over The Cabbage And Add Remaining 4 Cups, Stir To Mix. If You Can, Place A Plate Or Circular Baking Dish Of Sorts On Top To Submerge The Cabbage (I Used A Pie Dish), Place Something With A Good Amount Of Weight On Top To Hold Down If Necessary (It’S Not Completely Necessary But Will Help To Evenly Wilt The Cabbage). Give Cabbage A Good Mix Every Now And Then. Let Soak For 2 Hours, Up To 12 If You Like. I Found That 2 – 4 Hours Was Enough And Didn’T See Much Change Between The Two Times.
2. Make Your Seasonings: While Cabbage Is Soaking, Combine Apple, Onion, Ginger And Garlic In Food Processor/Blender And Process Until Fairly Smooth.
3. In A Small Bowl, Mix The Chili Pepper With A Small Amount Of Water To Make A Wet Paste. You Can Just As Easily Blend It With The Apple/Onion Mixture Adding A Couple Tablespoons Of Water As Well.

Mix Well To Coat All Pieces. Either Use Your Hands (With Gloves On Pref To Protect From The Chili Pepper) Or Simply Use Wooden Spoons To Toss Everything.
5. Packing: Place The Kimchi In Glass Jars Or Containers With Lid, Pack Down The Best You Can To Close Air Pockets And Leave About An Inch At The Top For Air And Gases. Top With Remaining Juices, Add Reserved Brine If Needed To Cover Vegetables.
6. Fermenting: Let Kimchi Sit At Room Temp (Or In A Cool Place Like A Pantry Or Closet If Weather Is Extremely Warm) For 24 – 36 Hours. After 24 Hours, Open Kimchi And Pack The Mixture Down With A Spoon (The Cabbage Will Have Likely Shrunk And You’Ll Have More Liquids). You May Notice It Bubbling, This Is Perfectly Normal As The Kimchi Is Fermenting. As Your Kimchi Ferments The Flavors Will Develop, Taste Every 24 Hours And Place Kimchi In The Refrigerator Once You’Re Happy With The Taste And To Slow Fermentation, Usually After 36 – 48 Hours. It Should Be Tangy, Spicy And Slightly Sweet. After Moving To The Fridge, It’S Best Used Within A Month, Maybe Two.

6. Adjust The Garlic To Your Taste. For A Mild Garlic Flavor, 2 Will Do. If You Love Your Garlic, Use More.
7. To Make This Completely Raw, Use 3/4 – 1 Teaspoon Mustard Powder In Place Of Dijon.
8. For Thinner Aioli, Add Extra Water, 1 – 2 Tablespoons, At A Time Until Desired Consistency.
9. If You Don’T Care For Dijon Mustard, Omit It All Together. You Can Also Start With 1 Teaspoon, Adding A Little Extra To Taste.
10. For This Task, I Used A Nutribullet Which Does A Great Job Blending Cashews Into Pure Creaminess. Plus, You Can Keep Your Aioli In The Cup It Was Blended In, Easily Storing Leftovers In The Refrigerator.
11. Soaking Cashews: If You Prefer To Soak Your Cashews, 2 Hours Before Preparing The Aioli, Place Cashews In A Cup/Bowl Filled With Water, Covering Cashews About 1 Inch. Let Set For 2 Hours. For A Quick Soak, Place Cashews In A Bowl Of Warm Water For 1 Hour, Or In Near Boiling Water For 15 Minutes. Drain And Rinse Well Before Blending. Use 2/3 Cup Of Water Instead Of 3/4 Cup, As The Cashews Will Have Plumped Up And You May Not Need As Much. Add More Water, 1 Tablespoon At A Time As Needed To Thin.

Alternately, You Can Chop The Basil Really Well And Mince The Garlic, Then Simply Mix All The Ingredients Together In A Small Container – Or Add The Basil To The Salad And Mix The Remaining Vinaigrette Ingredients Together. Set Aside To Let The Flavors Come Together. Taste Again Before Mixing To Adjust Flavor. Keep In The Refrigerator If Making A Day Or Two In Advance.
3. Prep: If Corn Has Husks, Either Remove Them Or Pull Away And Tie (As In The Pics Above), And Remove All The Silk Threads From Underneath. Cut Peaches Along The Seam All The Way Around And Twist Halves Off The Pit. Cut Zucchini In Half Lengthwise. If You Like Add A Light Of Oil To The Cut Side Of The Peaches And Zucchini Before Placing On The Grill, I Didn’T Do This Since I Oiled The Grill Directly.
4. Grill: Prep Your Grill And Add A Light Coat Of Oil. Start With The Corn First, It Will Take The Longest, About 10 Minutes Or So Depending On Your Grill. Then Add The Zucchini And Peaches Cut Side Down. The Last Two Should Grill Up Fairly Quickly, About 3 – 5 Minutes. I Leave Mine Al Dente.
5. Shuck & Slice: Once Done, Remove The Corn Off The Cob. Using A Large, Shallow, Rimmed Baking Dish Or Pie Dish, Hold The Corn By Its Top Horizontally In The Center, Use A Knife To Gently But Firmly Cut The Corn From The Cob From Top To Bottom. Give The Corn A 90 Turn And Repeat, Until All The Corn Is Removed. Slice Zucchini Into 1/4 – 1/2 Inch Slices. Slice Peaches Into 1/8 – 1/4 Inch Slices. Slice Tomatoes In Half. Slice Avocado In Half, Twist To Separate Halves, Remove Seed And Slice Thinly.
6. Combine: Add Quinoa To A Large Mixing Bowl, Along With The Peaches, Corn, Zucchini, Tomatoes, Chickpeas, Avocado And Pepitas, Toss To Combine. Add The Dressing And Mix Again. Add Mineral Salt & Fresh Cracked Pepper To Taste.
